            "[Document(page_content='After the tumultuous changes in the investment banking business follow- ing the financial crisis of 2007 through 2009, the entire landscape changed. Following the banking crisis, investment banks needed capital. Some of the most storied investment banks, unable to raise money, merged with other banks or became commercial banks themselves. Suddenly, the financial system was comprised of behemoth banks that have the deposit-taking abili- ties of banks but also engage in investment banking. The result is the forma- tion of several mega-institutions that many people fear are “too big to fail,” including the ones shown in Table 1-1 .\\n\\nTable 1-1 Firm\\n\\nAmong the Last Banks Standing\\n\\n2012 Revenue ($ billions)\\n\\nJPMorgan Chase\\n\\n91.7\\n\\nWells Fargo\\n\\n79.5\\n\\nBank of America Merrill Lynch\\n\\n75.2\\n\\nCitigroup\\n\\n59.3\\n\\nGoldman Sachs\\n\\n34.2\\n\\nMorgan Stanley Source: S&P Capital IQ ( www.capitaliq.com )\\n\\n26.1\\n\\n05_9781118615775-ch01.indd 14\\n\\n05_9781118615775-ch01.indd 14\\n\\n1/11/2014 3:33:54 AM\\n\\n1/11/2014 3:33:54 AM\\n\\nChapter 1: Introducing Investment Banking\\n\\n15\\n\\nTypes of investment banking operations\\n\\nInsiders in the investment banking business use all sorts of terms, some decidedly derogatory, to classify the players in the business. Some classifica- tions that investment banks fall into include the following:\\n\\n✓ Bulge bracket: Bulge bracket investment firms aren ’ t the ones that ate too many slices of cheesecake. Instead, bulge bracket is a commonly used slang term to describe the biggest of the big investment banking operations. The bulge bracket firms are the behemoths, like the ones in Table 1-1 . They have their hands in most areas of investment banking. ✓ Boutique: Boutique investment firms are smaller investment banks and traditional banks that choose to focus on one or a select few areas of the business. Some firms, for instance, focus on selling securities for smaller companies.\\n\\n✓ Regional: Regional firms typically focus on a particular part of the coun- try. Whereas the bulge bracket firms continually try to grow and take market share from rivals, there seems to be plenty of room for smaller players like these. Some regional firms also often concentrate on a particular type of investment banking service, be it trading services or underwriting of securities.\\n\\nHow investment banks get paid\\n\\nAs you can imagine, although investment banking plays an important role in funding economic progress, there ’ s also lots of money to be made. Investment bankers can ’ t afford those fancy suits if they ’ re not getting paid.\\n\\nInvestment bankers perform services for customers and collect money in a number of ways, include the following:', metadata={'source': 'data\\\\investmentbanking.pdf.pdf'}), Document(page_content='Of all the investment banks, few are as well known — and even as infamous — as Goldman Sachs. The firm ’ s long history in investment banking and its seeming omnipresence in markets around the world cement its recognized role as a premier investment bank. Remember: It ’ s important to note that Goldman, too, found itself in a world of hurt during the finan- cial crisis, and it had to turn to famed investor Warren Buffett to invest billions to help the company avoid a liquidity crisis. Goldman also borrowed billions from taxpayers, too. Nonetheless, those hoping to learn about investment banking, what it is, and how it works, are well served to look at the way Goldman Sachs structures its business and the size of those pieces, including the following: ✓ Institutional client services: The biggest part of Goldman ’ s business is what it calls institutional client services. Here, the firm arranges and helps conduct transactions for clients who want to buy and sell everything from bonds to foreign currencies and commodities, in a process called market making.
